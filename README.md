# Contribute
**Now I have switched to webscraping the image URLs.**

**URLs.txt contains all the Bulbapedia URLs scrapped.**

**But you Can still contribute in any form you feel like.**

**Like Rescaling the images for various purposes e.g. Thumbnails etc.**

*Guidelines:*
 * All Pokemon names must be renamed to their national dex no. and with appropriate formatting to facilitate easy access.
 * Please ensure that the quality requirements for the section are met.
 * You can acquire the assets in your own ways but be sure to stick to the quality.

*Thanks for your valuable contribution.*
