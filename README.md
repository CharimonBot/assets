 Also it contains a smaller version of the dataset from PokeAPI for offline usage (Which I used in my web app).
 
 This repository will be available as a public host for the highest quality Pokemon Images.
 
 Sugimori Artwork to begin with.
 
 Built to serve the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) in the future.
 
 Main source is Bulbapedia for Images.

# Getting Started:
**For Fetching Images:**
Generate URLs like this :
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HybridShivam/Pokemon/master/assets/images/001.png
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HybridShivam/Pokemon/master/assets/images/006-Gigantamax.png

Programmatically fetch base forms:
```
this.pokemonImageUrl = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HybridShivam/Pokemon/master/assets/images/' + 
                        this.pad(this.pokemon.id, 3) + '.png';
```
*Pad method:*
```
pad(number, length) {
    let str = '' + number;
    while (str.length < length) {
      str = '0' + str;
    }
    return str;
  }
```
*For Forms: Remember to follow Capital Casing with seperation with '-'
e.g. 254-Mega , 800-Dawn-Wings, 792-Full-Moon-Phase, 569-Gigantamax, 413-Sandy, 006-Mega-X, 025-Rock-Star etc.*
