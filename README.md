# Source
 WebScrapped from: 
 [Bulbapedia](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net)

# Getting Started:
**For Fetching Images:**
Generate URLs like this (For Base Forms) :
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HybridShivam/Pokemon/master/assets/images/001.png
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HybridShivam/Pokemon/master/assets/images/006-Gigantamax.png
```
this.pokemonImageUrl = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HybridShivam/Pokemon/master/assets/images/' + 
                        this.pad(this.pokemon.id, 3) + '.png';
```
*Pad method:*
```
pad(number, length) {
    let str = '' + number;
    while (str.length < length) {
      str = '0' + str;
    }
    return str;
  }
```
*For Forms: Remember to follow Capital Casing with seperation with '-'
e.g. 254-Mega , 800-Dawn-Wings, 792-Full-Moon-Phase, 569-Gigantamax, 413-Sandy, 006-Mega-X, 025-Rock-Star etc.*

**For the python Scripts:**

# URLs.txt

# Failed.txt
Contains all the exceptional URLs which can't be fetched due to exceptional naming in their page names like Mr. Mime's

```

# Contribute
**Now I have switched to webscraping the image URLs.**

**URLs.txt contains all the Bulbapedia URLs scrapped.**

**But you Can still contribute in any form you feel like.**

**Like Rescaling the images for various purposes e.g. Thumbnails.**

*Guidelines:*
 * All Pokemon names must be renamed to their national dex no. and with appropriate formatting to facilitate easy access.
 * Please ensure that the quality requirements for the section are met.
 * You can add other assets as well but be sure to stick to the quality.

*Thanks for your valuable contribution.*
